The only officially supported distributions are\n[TeX Live], and [MiKTeX]. Although, the latter is not as well tested and\nsupported as TeX Live, hence using TeX Live is highly recommended.\n\nYou need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution's binaries;\nby default the package uses your `PATH` environment variable, as well as the\nfollowing search paths on Linux and macOS\n\n1. `/usr/texbin`\n2. `/Library/TeX/texbin`\n\nand on Windows it uses\n\n1. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2016\\bin\\win32`\n2. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2015\\bin\\win32`\n3. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2014\\bin\\win32`\n4. `%ProgramFiles%\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin\\x64`\n5. `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin`\n\nIf your TeX distribution's binaries are not installed in one of those locations\nor discoverable via the `PATH` environment variable, you will need to help the\npackage find the binaries. This can be done by setting the *TeX Path*\nconfiguration option to point to the folder containing the binaries, either in\nthe settings view, or directly in your `config.cson` file. See [Configuration]\nfor further details regarding the settings of this package.\n\n#### TeX Live\nIf you're using TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no\nfurther action should be required.\n\n#### MiKTeX\nIf you're using MikTeX and have not installed the required `latexmk` package,\nlearn how to [use `latexmk` with MiKTeX][latexmk with MiKTeX].\n\n## Usage\nThe `latex:build` command can be invoked from the LaTex menu or by pressing the\ndefault keybind <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> while in a LaTex or\nknitr file. Log messages and any other messages from the build may be seen in\nthe LaTeX log panel accessible from the status bar.\n\nThe `latex` package supports other commands as detailed in the table below.\n\n| Command          | Keybinding                                  | Use                                                                  |\n|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `latex:build`    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> | Build LaTeX/knitr file and open result.                              |\n| `latex:rebuild`  | None                                        | Force a rebuild of LaTeX/knitr file.                                 |\n| `latex:clean`    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> | Cleanup files after a build.                                         |\n| `latex:sync`     | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>s</kbd> | Use SyncTeX forward if possible from the current cursor position.    |\n| `latex:sync-log` | None                                        | Display and highlight log messages from the current cursor position. |\n\n### Magic comments\nThis package has support for various \"magic\" TeX comments in the form of\n`% !TEX <name> = <value>` as detailed in the table below.\n\n| Name       | Value                                         | Use                                         |\n|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|\n| `format`   | `dvi`, `ps` or `pdf`                          | Override the output format                  |\n| `jobnames` | space separated names, e.g. `foo bar`         | Control the number and names of build jobs. |\n| `producer` | `dvipdf`, `dvipdfmx`, `xdvipdfmx` or `ps2pdf` | Override the PDF producer                   |\n| `program`  | `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, etc.                  | Override the LaTeX engine to use for build. |\n| `root`     | file path, e.g. `../file.tex`                 | Specify the root file that should be built. |\n\n### PDF/DVI/PS Viewers\nThe `latex` package currently supports [Evince], [Okular], [pdf-view],\n[Preview], [Skim], [Sumatra PDF] and [xdg-open] as PDF/DVI/PS viewers. This\nincludes support for cursor synchronization via SyncTeX if possible. Specific\nfeatures of each of the viewers is detailed at [Supported Viewers].\n\n## Development status\nPlease note that this package is in a **beta** state. It is stable, but lacks\nsome important features. As an example, there's no proper error and warning\nhandling.\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated!\n\n<!--refs-->\n[appveyor svg]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oc2v06stfwgd3bkn/branch/master?svg=true\n[appveyor]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thomasjo/atom-latex/branch/master\n[Configuration]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Configuration\n[dependency svg]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg\n[dependency]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex\n[devDependency svg]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex/dev-status.svg\n[devDependency]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex?type=dev\n[Evince]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince\n[knitr]: http://yihui.name/knitr/\n[latexmk with MiKTeX]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Using-latexmk-with-MiKTeX\n[MiKTeX]: http://miktex.org/\n[Okular]: https://okular.kde.org/\n[pdf-view]: https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view\n[Preview]: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740\n[Skim]: http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/\n[Sumatra PDF]: http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html\n[Supported Viewers]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Supported-Viewers\n[TeX Live]: https://www.tug.org/texlive/\n[travis svg]: https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg?branch=master\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex\n[xdg-open]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex#readme","_id":"latex@0.37.1","_shasum":"56190691be38d4dc3aa0ea64e6319b78d6e9958d","_resolved":"file:..\\d-116913-99208-16bg76w\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-116913-99208-16bg76w\\package.tgz"}
