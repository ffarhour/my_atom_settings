The only officially supported distributions are\n[TeX Live], and [MiKTeX]. Although, the latter is not as well tested and\nsupported as TeX Live, hence using TeX Live is highly recommended.\n\nYou need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution's binaries;\nby default the package uses your `PATH` environment variable, as well as the\nfollowing search paths on Linux and macOS\n\n1. `/usr/texbin`\n2. `/Library/TeX/texbin`\n\nand on Windows it uses\n\n1. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2016\\bin\\win32`\n2. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2015\\bin\\win32`\n3. `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2014\\bin\\win32`\n4. `%ProgramFiles%\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin\\x64`\n5. `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin`\n\nIf your TeX distribution's binaries are not installed in one of those locations\nor discoverable via the `PATH` environment variable, you will need to help the\npackage find the binaries. This can be done by setting the *TeX Path*\nconfiguration option to point to the folder containing the binaries, either in\nthe settings view, or directly in your `config.cson` file. See [Configuration]\nfor further details regarding the settings of this package.\n\n#### TeX Live\nIf you're using TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no\nfurther action should be required.\n\n#### MiKTeX\nIf you're using MikTeX and have not installed the required `latexmk` package,\nlearn how to [use `latexmk` with MiKTeX][latexmk with MiKTeX].\n\n## Usage\nThe `latex:build` command can be invoked from the LaTex menu or by pressing the\ndefault keybind <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> while in a LaTex or\nknitr file. Log messages and any other messages from the build may be seen in\nthe LaTeX log panel accessible from the status bar.\n\nThe `latex` package supports other commands as detailed in the table below.\n\n| Command               | Keybinding                                  | Use                                                                      |\n|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `latex:build`         | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> | Build LaTeX/knitr file and open result.                                  |\n| `latex:rebuild`       | None                                        | Force a rebuild of LaTeX/knitr file.                                     |\n| `latex:clean`         | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> | Cleanup files after a build.                                             |\n| `latex:kill`          | None                                        | Terminate currently running build. Also available from status indicator. |\n| `latex:sync`          | <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>s</kbd> | Use SyncTeX forward if possible from the current cursor position.        |\n| `latex:sync-log`      | None                                        | Display and highlight log messages from the current cursor position.     |\n| `latex:check-runtime` | None                                        | Check for the existence of `latexmk`, `Rscript` and PDF/PS/DVI viewers.  |\n\n### Overriding Build settings\nMany of the build settings in the settings page of the `latex` package can be\noverridden on a per file basis. One way to override specific build settings is\nto use \"magic\" TeX comments in the form of `% !TEX <name> = <value>`. Another\nway is to use a [YAML] formatted file with the same name as your root LaTeX\nfile, but with an extension of `.yaml`. The settings and values that can\noverridden via either method are listed in the table below. If multiple setting\nnames are listed then the first is preferred and following names are available\nfor compatibility. More details can found at [Overridding Build Settings].\n\n| Name                                    | Value                                          | Use                                                                                       |\n|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `cleanPatterns`                         | comma separated patterns, e.g. `**/*.blg, foo` | Specify patterns to use for `latex:clean`                                                 |\n| `enableSynctex`                         | `yes`, `no`, `true` or `false`                 | Override SyncTeX setting                                                                  |\n| `enableExtendedBuildMode`               | `yes`, `no`, `true` or `false`                 | Override extended build mode setting                                                      |\n| `enableShellEscape`                     | `yes`, `no`, `true` or `false`                 | Override shell escape setting                                                             |\n| `engine` or `program`                   | `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, etc.                   | Override the LaTeX engine to use for build.                                               |\n| `moveResultToSourceDirectory`           | `yes`, `no`, `true` or `false`                 | Override move result to source directory setting                                          |\n| `outputFormat` or `format`              | `dvi`, `ps` or `pdf`                           | Override the output format                                                                |\n| `jobNames`, `jobnames` or `jobname`     | comma separated names, e.g. `foo, bar`         | Control the number and names of build jobs.

Only available via \"magic\" TeX comments.      |\n\n### PDF/DVI/PS Viewers\nThe `latex` package currently supports [Atril], [Evince], [Okular], [pdf-view],\n[Preview], [Skim], [Sumatra PDF], Windows shell open, [xdg-open], [Xreader] and\n[Zathura] as PDF/DVI/PS viewers. This includes support for cursor\nsynchronization via SyncTeX if possible. Specific features of each of the\nviewers is detailed at [Supported Viewers].\n\n## Development status\nPlease note that this package is in a **beta** state. It is stable, but lacks\nsome important features.\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated!\n\n<!--refs-->\n[appveyor svg]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oc2v06stfwgd3bkn/branch/master?svg=true\n[appveyor]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thomasjo/atom-latex/branch/master\n[Atril]: http://mate-desktop.com/#atril\n[Configuration]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Configuration\n[dependency svg]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg\n[dependency]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex\n[devDependency svg]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex/dev-status.svg\n[devDependency]: https://david-dm.org/thomasjo/atom-latex?type=dev\n[Evince]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince\n[knitr]: http://yihui.name/knitr/\n[latexmk with MiKTeX]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Using-latexmk-with-MiKTeX\n[MiKTeX]: http://miktex.org/\n[Okular]: https://okular.kde.org/\n[Overridding Build Settings]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Overridding-Build-Settings\n[pdf-view]: https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view\n[Preview]: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740\n[Skim]: http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/\n[Sumatra PDF]: http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html\n[Supported Viewers]: https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Supported-Viewers\n[TeX Live]: https://www.tug.org/texlive/\n[travis svg]: https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg?branch=master\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex\n[xdg-open]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open\n[Xreader]: https://github.com/linuxmint/xreader\n[YAML]: http://yaml.org/\n[Zathura]: https://github.com/pwmt/zathura\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex#readme","_id":"latex@0.43.0","_shasum":"1cdc78305cbbef610c243bcf0939cf910d526485","_resolved":"file:..\\d-117413-11588-1udwzzu.qzq7low29\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-117413-11588-1udwzzu.qzq7low29\\package.tgz"}
